# Python and Data Science Projects

## Welcome
Welcome to the Python and Data Science Projects repository! This repository features a variety of projects showcasing different aspects of Python programming, data analysis, and machine learning. Each project is designed to demonstrate the application of various techniques and tools in real-world scenarios.

### Projects Overview

#### 1. Turtle Race Game

- **Objective:** Create a 2D color graph visualizer game.
- **Description:** A fun game implemented using the Turtle graphics library. Players can run the game on the command prompt or terminal.
- **Methodology:** Utilizes the Turtle library to create a simple race game where turtles (represented as colored shapes) race across the screen.

#### 2. Movie Industry Correlation

- **Objective:** Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the movie industry dataset.
- **Description:** Analyze relationships and correlations between various attributes in the movie dataset.
- **Methodology:** Use Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to visualize and explore data patterns.

#### 3. Intro To Data Modeling: Titanic Dataset Predictive Model

- **Objective:** Build a predictive model using the Titanic dataset.
- **Description:** Use machine learning techniques to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic.
- **Methodology:** Implement data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building using algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### 4. Smart Chatbot Program

- **Objective:** Develop a responsive chatbot using natural language processing (NLP).
- **Description:** Build a chatbot that can interact with users and respond to their queries.
- **Methodology:** Use NLP techniques and libraries like NLTK and spaCy to process and understand user inputs. Implement the chatbot logic to generate appropriate responses.

#### 5. Employee Churn Predictor Model

- **Objective:** Predict employee churn using machine learning.
- **Description:** Analyze employee data to identify patterns and factors contributing to churn. Build a model to predict which employees are likely to leave.
- **Methodology:** Perform data preprocessing, feature selection, and model building using algorithms like logistic regression, support vector machines, and gradient boosting. Evaluate model performance using various metrics.

#### 6. Email Spam Detection

- **Objective:** Detect spam emails using machine learning.
- **Description:** Build a classifier to identify spam emails based on their content and metadata.
- **Methodology:** Use Python libraries like sklearn to preprocess the data, extract features, and build classification models such as Naive Bayes, decision trees, and support vector machines. Evaluate the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
